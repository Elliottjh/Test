I notice you've provided your Firebase configuration code. Let me update the website code to use your Firebase configuration format correctly.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

# Your Firebase Configuration Has Been Applied

I've updated the website code with your specific Firebase configuration. Here are the changes I made:

1. **Added Your Firebase Configuration**:
   - Applied your exact Firebase configuration values (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.)
   - Maintained your measurementId parameter that was in your configuration

2. **Added Firebase Analytics Support**:
   - Added the Firebase Analytics SDK script since your configuration includes analytics
   - This enables the analytics functionality referenced in your configuration

## Important Next Steps

With your Firebase configuration in place, you're ready to deploy the website. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Copy the entire code** from the updated artifact
2. **Create a new GitHub repository** and upload it as `index.html`
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings
4. **Test your Firebase connection** by submitting a name through the form

## Firebase Compatibility Note

The website is using the Firebase "compat" version (compatibility version) which works with the configuration format you provided. This means:

- Your configuration works directly with the code as written
- No need to modify any Firebase initialization code
- The Firebase SDK handles both your config format and the code format

The Firebase Firestore database will automatically be created when you first submit data through the form. Since your project is already set up, you should be able to see the data immediately in your Firebase Console.

Let me know if you need any assistance with deployment or if you encounter any issues with the Firebase integration!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
